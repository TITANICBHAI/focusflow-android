## FocusFlow — Android Productivity App

`artifacts/focusflow` — Expo (React Native) Android app combining intelligent task scheduling with OS-level app blocking via custom Kotlin native services.

### Architecture

- **JS layer (control plane)** — writes config to SharedPreferences, displays UI, manages app state (AppContext).
- **Kotlin layer (execution plane)** — owns timing, enforcement, and recovery. Never relies on JS being alive.

### Native Services

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ForegroundTaskService.kt` | Always-running foreground service. IDLE mode: quiet persistent notification. ACTIVE mode: task countdown + blocking. Never stopped — goes IDLE instead. |
| `AppBlockerAccessibilityService.kt` | Intercepts every window-change event. Enforces both task-based AND standalone block lists independently. Self-heals stale SharedPrefs flags when timestamps pass. |
| `BootReceiver.kt` | Restarts `ForegroundTaskService` on reboot — in ACTIVE mode if a task session was running, IDLE mode otherwise (always-on). |

### SharedPreferences Schema (`focusday_prefs`)

| Key | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `focus_active` | Boolean | Task focus session is active |
| `task_name` | String | Current task display name |
| `task_end_ms` | Long | Task session end epoch ms |
| `next_task_name` | String? | Next task name for notification sub-text |
| `allowed_packages` | String (JSON array) | Apps allowed during task focus (NOT StringSet — reference bug) |
| `standalone_block_active` | Boolean | Standalone (no-task) block is enabled |
| `standalone_blocked_packages` | String (JSON array) | Apps always blocked until expiry |
| `standalone_block_until_ms` | Long | Standalone block expiry epoch ms |

### Blocking Logic (Collision Handling)

When both task-based focus and standalone block are active simultaneously, enforcement is **additive (union)**:
- Task focus: blocks every app NOT in `allowed_packages`
- Standalone block: blocks every app IN `standalone_blocked_packages`
- Both are checked independently — the more restrictive rule wins for each app

### Key JS Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/context/AppContext.tsx` | Global state, `setStandaloneBlock()`, starts idle service on init |
| `src/services/focusService.ts` | Starts/stops task focus. Calls `goHome()` after activation. |
| `src/components/AllowedAppsModal.tsx` | Picker for allowed apps (task focus) |
| `src/components/StandaloneBlockModal.tsx` | Picker for blocked apps + date/time expiry (standalone) |
| `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` | Settings screen including Block Schedule section |

### Deferred Feature: Full-screen Lock Overlay

**Idea:** When "Activate Focus" is tapped, instead of just going to the home screen, a full-screen lock UI appears over the home screen showing the active task name and a live countdown timer. The overlay is non-dismissable during the focus session (Back is intercepted) and auto-dismisses when the session ends.

**Implementation plan (NOT yet implemented):**

1. **New `FocusLockActivity`** — a dedicated Kotlin `Activity` with `Theme.Black.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen`. It reads task name + end time from SharedPreferences and shows a live countdown. Back button is intercepted and no-ops.

2. **Launch mechanism** — two options:
   - `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` permission on the `ForegroundTaskService` notification (no SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW needed, works on API < 34 without user grant). The notification's `setFullScreenIntent()` launches `FocusLockActivity`.
   - OR: `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` (Draw over other apps) — a `WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` view. More powerful but requires explicit user grant on API ≥ 23.

3. **Manifest registration** — add `FocusLockActivity` to `withFocusDayAndroid.js` config plugin (careful: this file is delicate, test after any touch). Add `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` permission if using option A.

4. **Dismiss trigger** — `ForegroundTaskService` fires a local broadcast (e.g. `com.tbtechs.focusflow.FOCUS_ENDED`) that `FocusLockActivity` listens for and uses to `finish()` itself.

5. **JS stub already exists** — `ForegroundLaunchModule.showOverlay(message)` is a placeholder that currently calls `bringToFront()`. Wire it to launch `FocusLockActivity` instead.

## Packages

### `artifacts/focusflow` (`@workspace/focusflow`)

The main FocusFlow Android app. All persistence is local SQLite via expo-sqlite. No backend server.

### `scripts` (`@workspace/scripts`)

Utility scripts package. Each script is a `.ts` file in `src/` with a corresponding npm script in `package.json`.
